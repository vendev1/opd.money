opd.money is a Sharia-Compliant decentralised lending and borrowing protocol that combines the principles of Islamic finance with decentralised technology. It enables individuals to engage in lending and borrowing activities without traditional intermediaries while strictly adhering to Sharia law. The protocol prohibits interest (riba) and promotes fair profit-sharing and risk-sharing. By leveraging blockchain, opd.money provides a secure and transparent environment for participants to access financial services while upholding their religious beliefs. At the same time, our goal is to introduce Sharia-Compliant DeFi and Islamic finance to more people around the world as it (Islamic finance) is often considered more fair and equitable compared to traditional finance due to its adherence to principles such as justice, transparency, and risk-sharing.


## Sharia-Com–øliant Peer-to-Peer crypto lending

Peer-to-peer or P2P crypto lending is a process that lets a user lend cryptocurrencies directly to a borrower who wants to take out a crypto-backed loan. P2P crypto lending minimises the role of the third party (even the platform itself) in the lending and borrowing processes. P2P lending and borrowing fits into the Sharia-Compliance framework perfectly, as Islamic finance prohibits the charging or earning of interest (Riba). Islamic finance promotes the principle of risk-sharing and emphasises the use of alternative mechanisms such as profit-sharing, equity-based financing, and asset-backed transactions. These principles aim to foster fairness, justice, and a more equitable distribution of wealth in financial transactions.

Rather than funding the loan itself, with the use of P2P opd.money, users can:

* Set rates, terms and rewards of the loan, sharing the risk between both parties.
* Ease money transfers between lender and borrower.
* Ask the borrower to pay down or add more collateral as a fixed cost for the loan, if the value drops significantly.
* Collaborate with a custodian to hold the crypto assets while the loan is in repayment.
* Offer some kind of insurance to protect the collateral in repayment.

On a P2P platform, lenders choose the rates, terms and amount they want to fund. That allows for more control over the investment than parking that money in an account that offers a flat APY.
